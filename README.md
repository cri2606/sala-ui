Sala-UI is a Tailwind CSS-based UI component library designed to simplify the creation of modern and efficient user interfaces. The library includes a selection of ready-to-use components that can be easily customized and integrated into your projects.

## Requirements

Sala-UI requires **Tailwind CSS** to work properly. Make sure you have Tailwind already installed and configured in your project.

### Installing Tailwind CSS

If you haven't installed Tailwind CSS yet, you can do it by following these steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Create the Tailwind configuration file:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

3. Configure Tailwind in your CSS file:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

4. Make sure Tailwind is properly configured in your project by following the [official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

The **Sala-UI** library includes the following pre-built components:

- **Button**: A customizable button component with various styles.
